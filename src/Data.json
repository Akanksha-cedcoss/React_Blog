        "content": "Becoming a Buddhist used to be a thing of the east before the 50s. Ever since the eastern world opened its arms towards the western societies, many people from the west are also getting into becoming a Buddhist by reading books about Buddhism, practicing Buddhist meditation and also by applying Buddhist principles in their daily lives. So what does becoming a Buddhist mean in today’s day and age? How does one become a Buddhist? Anyone interested in Dharma may come to a point where he or she would want to decide whether they truly are a Buddhist or not. Buddhist people around the world normally relate or depict themselves as content and joyful people. But does becoming a Buddhist tremendously change the world around us? What changes will it bring to the people who embrace the teachings of the Buddha, the enlightened one? To put it in simple terms, one does not need to wear any special robes, change his or her eating habits, give up material possessions or any kind of social life. Becoming a Buddhist simply means changing one’s insight into anything that is happening around them. One would see everything around him or her as interesting as well as full of potential, which is very easy or simple to say but usually not easy to do. Anyone can be a Buddhist. An individual does not particularly have to be born or raised in Buddhist culture nor do anyone’s parents have to be Buddhist. The said individual can be of any race, region, gender, socio-economic background, etc. Anyone who identifies themselves as Buddhists commonly take part in a ceremony known as taking refuge in the three gems; the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha. This ceremony involves the simple act of reciting the refuge verse three times. This verse reveals the participant’s confidence and trust in the Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha so as to alleviate suffering and to ultimately attain enlightenment.",
